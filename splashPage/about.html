    my name is khalil edwards and i am a soon to be graduate from
    mcdaniel college. i am majoring in philosophy. so what is this then?
    well, i'm honestly not quite sure yet. i took several CS classes
    in college, and started to really like it. 
    i know that i want
    to learn how to program. i am looking at front end
    more than back end because that is where i feel more
    confident. but this is some hard stuff. i will get into
    it more in another section but that is just a breif
    overview of what i'm up to.
